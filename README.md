 A Text-to-Image Generator using Machine Learning with Python project involves developing a system that can generate images based on textual descriptions using machine learning techniques.
Example Workflow:
Input: "A dog playing with a ball in the park."
Text Embedding: Convert the text into a vector representation.
Image Generation: Pass the text embedding into the generator network to produce an image.
Output: An image of a dog playing with a ball in the park.
